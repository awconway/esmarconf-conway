# ESMARConf presentation

This repo contains a code for a presentation on using the {flextable} package to create a 'graphical' study characteristics table for systematic reviews.

Systematic reviews are a type of academic publication, which involves the identification, critical appraisal and synthesis of results from multiple studies. It is very common in these types of publications for a 'summary' of the characteristics of each study included in the systematic review to be presented in the form of a table consisting entirely of text. This presentation demonstrates how the [flextable](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/articles/overview.html) package was used to replace some of the text with graphical features for a study characteristics table. The printing of the table in landscape format in the knitted word document was achieved using the [officedown](https://davidgohel.github.io/officedown/) package. This table format is highly customisable. An example of a published static-print table using this same format, which we created for an earlier publication, is available [here](https://rdcu.be/b4AoO). Some features of the table include:

- Use of a coloured inline 'minibar' images to show the male:female ratio in included studies
- Images of flags (using [flagon](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/2020/04/03/introducing-flagon-a-package-of-just-flag-images-in-png-and-svg-format/)) to indicate the country (in addition to being aesthetically more pleasing than presenting this information in text, this feature also reduced the amount of horizontal space required for this column, which is useful for static-print tables that need to be incorporated into Word documents).
- Use of inline 'minibar' images so the reader can more quickly and clearly distinguish between studies that included higher numbers of participants than if the information was presented in text format.
